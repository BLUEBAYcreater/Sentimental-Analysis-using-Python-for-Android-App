If you were around in summer 1989 then you'll remember that Batmania
 was EV-ER-Y-WHERE! You couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Bat Logo
 in some incarnation. The film was a mega-hit. People were queueing up around the 
block for hours (the literal meaning of a blockbuster). I remember being in a car, 
driving up Lothian Road in Edinburgh and seeing a long line of people queuing at the
 box office of the Cannon Cinema (as it was then) and being jealous that I wasn't old enough to see it. 
My lot of movies that summer was restricted to Ghostbusters II and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, both of which I saw in Florida. Batman had a 12-rating in the UK, and was upped to 15 for video. This "grown up" rating gave it an alluring mystique as was always 
the case with such movies to my hungry, impressionable mind.
