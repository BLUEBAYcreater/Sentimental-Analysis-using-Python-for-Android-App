A beautiful and very entertaining animated sequel that makes me have a nice time for a magical hour and a half.
Frozen II may sing about change, but that progress is what you project onto it.
"Frozen II" is sure to please the kiddies and their parents with catchy tunes and wondrous animation, 
Frozen 2 may not warm the cockles of your heart quite to the extent that Frozen did, 
but it will, if you sit back and let it sweep over you, take your breath away.
even if it makes the plot more complicated than it needs to be for its target audience.
